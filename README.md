# Coordinator
### Never settle for "be there in five minutes"

## How does it work?
Unlike similar programs, coordinator works across all devices and there's no need to download any app or create new accounts. All that's needed is setting up an event and sending the link to friends. Based off of the destination which is inputted, ETA for all users is calculated and shown to all users. Page is updated every 1 minute across all devices and manual refresh is available.

## Where is it now?
Most of the pages have been updated or created, but only a few are complete. Most of the back-end is complete, deleting users is complete, and the program screen is hard-coded but complete.
